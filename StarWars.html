        </h1>
        <h2 class="skewed-text" id="h2">STOPPING &nbsp;WEAPON
            &nbsp;TRAFFICKING</h2>
        <p class="skewed-text"> All around the world 500 000 people get
            killed by weapon that no one knew about, that were not
            regulated</p>
        <p class="skewed-text"> A first concern is the shear amount of weapons (even legal ones) in circulation, we will
            buy every major iron mine in the world to control the iron distribution, to limit the ability of weapon
            factory to work
            We have developed a system that allows anyone to identify an illegal weapon and moreover allow police forces
            to detect those weapons even at a distance, with long range tracking devices that reemit signals sent by
            satellites. First of all, this system is free ! we will pay for it for every weapon that will be brought to
            us and that the country that you are a citizen of can confirm is not modified, etc… This solution basically
            consists of two tracking devices, one in the chamber and one in the body, those trackers would not use any
            battery and they would be impossible to remove without destroying the weapon and if they were separated, it
            would call armed forces specially trained by us for free !
            Another part of the dispositif would be multiple measures to make legal weapons more visible. It would
            consist of a bronze block that will be embedded in the body of the firearm, and if possible, a thin bronze
            tube soldered on all of its length on the barrel. All of these solutions would make anyone able to identify
            a weapon within a glare of it and if it’s not appropriate, call the police, a national specialised group or
            our special intervention unit, that we will deploy in every country that will let us do it for FREE !!!
            We advise country to add a new rule that every weapon brought to one of our “shops” will be legalised, if
            needed
            We would propose training for civilians and armed forces for free for everyone to be able to react when
            seeing a weapon.


        </p>
        <p class="skewed-text"> Some might argue that it will impossible to label all weapons, because people with
            illegal weapon would not go to add this “securite mesure”, but we are not targeting this sort of
            individuals, we are targeting “Jean-michel who kept his AK-47 gold after the war and hides it under his bed,
            doesn’t use it and might just sell it to any terrorist that offers him money. With this new system, he will
            be able to sell the weapon and be sure that it will not be used for a malicious use; The problem of groups
            will disappear by itself, because if we limit the production of firearms, and that all new firearms are
            equipped with this system, the number of illegal weapon will go down and theirs prices will skyrocket and
            armed groups won’t have as many weapons in a few years.
